# Project Vision and Strategy

## 1. Vision

To create `actualgamesearch.com`, a public-facing, feature-rich game search engine that offers both precise, keyword-based search and AI-powered semantic discovery. The project's primary mandate is to achieve this with an **ultra-low operational cost**, targeting a monthly expenditure of less than $10.

## 2. Core Strategy: Cloudflare-First Hybrid Architecture

The project will exclusively utilize the Cloudflare Developer Platform. This strategic decision is based on the following principles:

*   **Cost Optimization:** Aggressively leverage Cloudflare's generous free tiers for Workers, Pages, D1, Vectorize, and R2 to minimize operational costs.
*   **Integrated Ecosystem:** Utilize Cloudflare's tightly integrated suite of services to reduce complexity and improve performance.
*   **Serverless-First:** Employ serverless components (Workers, Containers, D1, Vectorize) that scale to zero, ensuring that resources are only consumed when needed.

The core of the application will be a **Hybrid Search Model**, which combines the strengths of traditional keyword-based search with modern semantic search capabilities. This approach provides a superior user experience by allowing for both precise filtering and conceptual discovery.

## 3. Key Architectural Principles

*   **Offline Pre-computation:** All computationally intensive tasks, such as data scraping, text cleaning, and vector embedding generation, will be performed in an offline ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline. This ensures that the live, user-facing API remains lightweight and responsive.
*   **Client-Side Power (Future Goal):** While the initial implementation will rely on a serverless backend, the long-term vision includes exploring client-side inference using Blazor WebAssembly and the ONNX Runtime. This would further reduce server-side costs and enhance user privacy.
*   **Open Source:** The resulting project will be developed as an open-source template, providing a blueprint for building low-cost, high-performance multimodal search applications.
